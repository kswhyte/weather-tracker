### React/Redux Weather Forecast Application

This project template was built with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

###Specification

####Overview:

In this project we built a react/redux weather app that allows you to see different forecast information for a given city, and set favorite cities to pin to the home page.

####Main Goals:

- Retrieve and display forecast data from the OpenWeatherMap API
- Use the Geolocation API to determine the weather in your current city
- Save “pinned” or favorite cities to display their extended weather forecasts

####API Key:

We used the OpenWeatherMap API to retrieve weather data. The OpenWeatherMap API does not use security precaution, and thus has enabled cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) on their servers. Thus when testing this app, it is necessary to allow your browser to load "unsafe scripts" in order to render fresh weather information and current weather data.
